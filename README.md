# rock-paper-scissors
A Rock Paper Scissors game made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.\
The live version can be found here ðŸ‘‰ https://rytismark.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/

The first version of the game was run automatically and logged in console only. Then I created an UI and incorporated interactability so an actual person could play it.\
While coding the project, I had the chance to try out various DOM methods, learn how event listeners work, try out hover and transform effects on buttons and had fun making the logic for the game.
